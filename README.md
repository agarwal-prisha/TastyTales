# 🍽️ TastyTales

**TastyTales** is an intelligent recipe recommendation and management system that blends **Java Swing**, **MySQL**, and **Machine Learning** to deliver personalized recipe suggestions.  
It allows users to register, set dietary preferences and allergies, and view curated recipes from a large dataset.

## 🚀 Features

- 👤 **User Authentication** — Secure registration and login system.  
- 🍲 **Recipe Dashboard** — Displays recipes dynamically from the dataset.  
- 🧠 **Machine Learning Recommendations** — Suggests recipes based on user preferences and similarity scoring.  
- ⚙️ **Preference Management** — Users can specify their diet (e.g., Vegan, Keto) and allergens.  
- 🧾 **Data Persistence** — Recipes, users, and preferences are stored in MySQL.  
- 🎨 **Interactive UI** — Intuitive and responsive design built using Java Swing.

## 🧠 ML Workflow (Recommendation System)

1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Loaded dataset (`recipes_10000_v2.csv`) containing features like cuisine, diet, ingredients, and allergens.  
   - Cleaned and vectorized text fields using **TF-IDF**.

2. **Modeling**  
   - Applied **Cosine Similarity** to find recipes similar to user preferences.  
   - Generated ranked recommendations dynamically.

3. **Integration with Java App**  
   - Exported the recommendation output as a `.csv` file or API endpoint.  
   - Java retrieves and displays recommended recipes in the dashboard UI.
